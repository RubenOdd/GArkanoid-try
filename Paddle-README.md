# Why Paddle

I chose to use CharacterBody2D to be able to move it as per player's wants and inputs. It doesn't use physics, so we can make them ourselves.

### Possible Problems

- Ball going through the paddle
- Weird shape of the paddle will make it more annoying to make collision

### Buffs and Debuffs

- Make it double the balls when they hit the paddle
- Go faster
- Make it bigger
- Make balls bigger
- Make it shoot projectiles

- Go slower
- Make it smaller
- Make balls smaller
